I am a student with a strong and consistent track record of success in solving problems, improving efficiencies and in being on the cusp of leading-edge technology development, I understand the importance of results. Being an astute student and practitioner of software engineering has provided me with the ability to analyze processes, manage projects, uncover cost-cutting opportunities, and increase efficiencies. I revel in the challenges of accomplishing goals where others have failed. I am a passionate contributor with a laser-focus on the bottom line to increase shareholder value.
